		<aside class="notes"> 
	                          The idea for a barcode first emerged in 1948 when a graduate student at Drexel Institute of Technology in Philadelphia approached the president of a supermarket chain. He wanted to undertake a project that could potentially develop a system to automatically could read product information. This idea eventually got passed on to a professor at the same university and the professor would pursue that idea. He essentially made a product using ultra violet ink in a lined pattern. This idea would later be commercialized in 1966 and barcode scanners would begin being manufactured. By 1974, most supermarkets would be using the barcode.

		<aside class="notes"> 
	                          The term “hyperlink” was coined in 1966, around the same time barcodes were being manufactured. It was an idea in which something could link any two pages of related information by leaving some sort of trail. The very same year a programming team first implemented the idea by connecting paragraphs in the same microfilm reel. It would scroll to a specific document. I find it interested that the idea of a hyperlink emerged from a microfilm reel.  In 1987, a hyperlink was developed for the Apple Macintosh that allowed two pages of information to connect.

                           With the creation of the CueCat and the commercial QR code, audiences were confused of how to handle each type of media. Introducing something so new where there was no crystal clear benefit for the user did not go over very well/ I believe there should have been a lot more money invested in advertising the products. Maybe then would the audience grasp the idea of both QR code and the barcode.
