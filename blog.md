# Less is More?

Franco Moretti, an literary scholar, claims that we must stop reading books in order to understand literature. In Graphs, Maps and Trees: Abstract Models for a Literary History, he introduces an idea called “distant reading”. Distant reading is the method of analyzing large amounts of data from texts to fully understand them instead of studying and reading particular pieces. Moretti believes using quantifiable text analysis allows scholars to view data on a global scale rather than perceptible one. This notion advocates for an entire reconceptualization of literature and what was previously thought about it. 

The allowance of distant reading is beneficial but the only way to fully commit to distant reading is to sacrifice the subjectivity in literature. In order to graph and map data, the subject that is being analyzed must be possible to categorize and must have a specific metric. There are certain things that are immeasurable. Some examples may include: emotion, pertinence or a certain writing style. Moretti has considered this argument: “Quantitative research provides a type of data which is ideally independent of interpretations, I said earlier, and that is of course also its limit: it provides data, not interpretation.” (Moretti, 2005). Moretti is entirely aware that full quantitative analysis of literature diminishes interpretation but believes the wide scope of statistical analytics provides more insight than the small details that interpretation provides. Moretti explains when introducing the idea of distant reading: “It allows you to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices, themes, tropes-or genres and systems. And if, between the very small and the very large, the text itself disappears, well, it is one of those cases when one can justifiably say, Less is more. If we want to understand the system in its entirety, we must accept losing something.” (Moretti, 2005) This incites an idea that if we want to understand the system fully, interpretation must be sacrificed. 

Below is a world cloud to provide visualization to Moretti’s Graphs, Map, Trees: Abstract Models for a Literary History’s most used words. Some of the most used are novel, genres, history, new, years, English and literature. While these words provide insight on topics touched upon in the Graphs, Maps, Trees, it is unable to fully grasp as understanding of the topics touched upon in the course. This supports an idea that even though computer programs can categorize data, it fails to understand it like a human would. Computers are limited in hermeneutics. Thus, we are unable to fully get a humanistic approach to the data.


Stephen Ramsay, author of Reading Machines: Toward and Algorithmic Criticism, argues that Moretti’s point assumes that every except data is rhetorical. “But one wonders why it is necessary to speak of these insights as proceeding from that which is "independent of interpretation" and which leads to the "falsification'' of ideas obtained through more conventional humanistic means. It is as if everything under discussion is a rhetorical object except the "data”. (Ramsay, 2012). Ramsay brings up an excellent point that discussion should include everything plus data, not just data. He also says “Texts are browsed, searched, and disseminated by all but the most hardened Luddites in literary study, but seldom are they transformed algorithmically as a means of gaining entry to the deliberately and self-consciously subjective act of critical interpretation.” 

  In the field of Digital Humanities, it seems as if the humanistic side is taking a backseat in this type of analysis rather than the digital side. Johanna Drucker offers a solution in Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display, by explaining the difference between data and capta. It is explained that all capta is being taken actively by a person while data is given, capable of being recorded and observed. She believes that all data must be understood as capta in order to make progress in the system. (Drucker, 2011).  Even with capta, I believe that to provide a visualization of it, it must be translated it to numbers first which is a form of data. While the visualization of capta is something that can be used to show graphical statistics in literature, it still does not compare to close reading a human can do. 
In conclusion, it comes down to a debate on whether distant reading versus close reading. Distant reading can provide a global scope of statistics in literature but must sacrifice the small hermeneutical details of human interpretation. On the other hand, close reading provides those small hermeneutical details with a much smaller scope. Again, Moretti explains how in order to progress, we must overlook these details if we want to fully understand the system. In the end it boils down to perspective.
